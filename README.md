## Protecting users’ privacy: a role-playing game.

### Session Description:
Hackers, governmental entities, malicious ads, coffeeshop snoopers, airline Wi-fi, us-- all of these have the potential to violate the privacy of our users, our staff, and our sources. What responsibility does a newsroom have to protect these group’s privacy and personal information? How can we realistically fulfill these responsibilities? How can we assess what we have control over and what we can’t control?

Privacy in the digital world is complex and it is time for newsrooms to solidify their footing with new guidelines and tips. We want to explore multiple scenarios involving a privacy breach. The scenarios will cover behavioral, technological, and ethical issues based on real-life examples. You, the newsroom, will tackle the situation given to you. Your mission: come up with a set of guidelines on how to prevent and respond to your specific scenario.

### The Rules
+ Work as a group.
+ Consider your newsroom's resources
+ Take notes!
+ Consider:
  + How you can prevent these scenarios from happening again.
  + How you can deal with these scenarios properly.

### The Goal
Come up with a set of guidelines and principles for newsroom to consult. The guidelines should cover ethical, behavioral, and technological threats to users privacy. The document will be open-sourced.
