### The Scenario

Last week, one of your reporters wrote a story about an infamous troll, who also happens to be an influential 4chan user.

While there has been no direct attacks as of yet, the number of threats has increased, with messages popping up on boards and social media. Memes are being passed around claiming that the reporter in question is a sex offender, encouraging people to do “what it takes”. The safety and privacy of your employees are at stake.
