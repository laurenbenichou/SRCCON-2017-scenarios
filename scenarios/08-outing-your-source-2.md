### The Scenario

Your company has several very secure ways to gain information from sources. You have a SecureDrop setup to allow for secure and anonymous delivery of documents to your journalists. They all follow the protocol to a T, and ensure that nothing digital is leaked.

Shortly after you published a major story about a hidden government program, the leaker is outed and arrested. It turns out, the documents you received via SecureDrop and shared with the government to  corroborate your story had micro dots on them that allowed them to track down the user who printed them. Your source could face prison time.


### Your Newsroom

**You:** Local newspaper.

**Resources**:  One developer (overworked), and an expensive out-of-house counsel.
