### The Scenario

You are a developer on the revenue team who has been tasked with adding in a new campaign that was just sold. It was a major sale that will bring critical revenue to the company, and ensure the quarter will be successful. At first, everything seems normalâ€” but upon closer inspection they are asking for four different trackers to be placed within each adâ€” one of which seems like it could be malicious. Even so, there is high pressure from company leadership to push this deal forward as quickly as possible.  



### Your Newsroom

**You:** Major newspaper.

**Resources**: Large development team, legal team, and a full PR team to assist you.
