### The Scenario

You just woke up and looked at the front page of the newspaper you work for. The very first article that appears is Pressure builds in House to elect CHIPPY 1337. The article is a clear hack, with several disparaging images and phrases within the body. Immediately the engineering team steps up to take the article down, but the account that was used to create it was brand new and given permissions of an editor. At this point, you are unsure how this account was created or if they have altered any other articles on the site.

**Resources**:  One developer (overworked), and an expensive out-of-house counsel.
