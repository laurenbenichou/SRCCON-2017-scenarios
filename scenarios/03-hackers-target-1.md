### The Scenario

Last week, one of your writers wrote a story about an infamous troll that is near and dear to the 4chan armies. Immediately thereafter it came to your attention from security firms that there was planning to launch an attack against your staff to gain any compromising information from the firm. While there have been no direct attacks yet, there have been threats made on message boards and twitter threatening the safety and security of your employees. There are also memes being passed around claiming that the reporter is a child molestor and telling people to do “what it takes”.
