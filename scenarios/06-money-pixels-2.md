### The Scenario

You are a developer on the revenue team. You have been tasked with adding in a new ad campaign that your company just sold space for. It was a major sale, which will bring critical revenue to the company. At first, everything seems normal. Upon closer inspection, you notice that the ad will include four different trackers, one of which seems like it could be malicious. Even so, there is high pressure coming down from your bosses to push this campaign forward as quickly as possible.  


### Your Newsroom

**You:** Local newspaper.

**Resources**:  One developer (overworked), and an expensive out-of-house counsel.
