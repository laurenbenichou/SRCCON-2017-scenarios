### The Scenario

You are a developer on the revenue team who has been tasked with adding in a new campaign that was just sold. While it isnâ€™t a particularly large sale, it will help ensure that the revenue from this quarter is steady. At first, everything seems normalâ€” but upon closer inspection they are asking for four different trackers to be placed within each ad. Even so, there is high pressure from company leadership to push this deal forward as quickly as possible.


### Your Newsroom

**You:** Local newspaper.

**Resources**:  One developer (overworked), and an expensive out-of-house counsel.
